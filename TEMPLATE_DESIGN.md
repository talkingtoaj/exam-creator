# Exam transparency and security via hundreds of variations

The template exam is designed to have a set of several standard sections, each with multiple alternative questions of equivalent difficulty on the same general topic. When a unique exam is constructed, all common sections are included and just ONE randomly selected alternative question for each section.

## Designing a template exam that serves your educational goals

If you are educating for professional competence, the exam should test for competence in scenarios commonly encountered by practicioners. Surveying a group of practicioners is a good way to collect the above information. 

Here is an example of a survey you can use:
  Thank you for assisting us with this survey. Please read the example questions and answer the following questions as best you can:

  Q1: What skills do you hope a graduate from our program would have in order to be valuable collegue? Name the top 3-5 most important skills.

  Q2: Can you give a hypothetical scenario which would show clearly if a graduate has the necessary competence for each of the skills you mentioned above. If possible, give some specific fictional details for each scenario.

Upon receiving answers for your survey back from multiple teams or individuals, it is helpful to consider the scenarios that are independently reported repeatedly. These are most likely the scenarios that you want to work into your exam’s questions.

### Striving for equivalent difficulty

A final consideration that is important for exam design is to try to ensure all questions are of similar difficulty. Questions that are more difficult add additional stress on a student during an exam and can result in greater hesitancy and mistakes which can unfairly misrepresent a student when they are assessed alongside students who received simpler questions. 

For this reason, it may be necessary to reject some commonly encountered scenarios if answering them would be far harder (or easier), than the other common scenarios.
* Consider the cognitive difficulty required to formulate an answer to each question. 
* Consider the depth of specific industry knowledge needed to answer the question. You don’t want a question that expects a student who has yet to enter the industry to have deep knowledge of a specific company that is not going to be also true or relevant in other companies.
* Consider the time required to thoughtfully formulate an answer. You don’t want questions that can be answered in 1 minute alongside questions that would reasonably take 15 minutes to thoughtfully answer.
